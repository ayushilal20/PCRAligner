# PCRAligner

In this project, I developed a comprehensive bioinformatics package named "Magnum Opus" as part of the Programming for Bioinformatics course (BIOL 7200). The package integrates multiple bioinformatics tools and algorithms to facilitate in-silico PCR and sequence alignment tasks. The project involved the following key components:

1. isPCR Module:
* Developed a Python module to simulate in-silico PCR (isPCR).
* The module takes primer and assembly files as input and returns predicted amplicons.
* Unified the different steps of the isPCR process into a single callable function.
